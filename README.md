Auto Experience Distribution for Foundry VTT

Adds total experience value of deceased enemy NPCs and divides it between any living PCs in the combat tracker. Triggers on combat end. Distributed experience will be displayed in a chat message once it is distributed.

Currently this is not configurable, may add configuration settings to a later release.
